# ElectronicArts_SoftwareEngineer
I completed the Electronic Arts Software Engineering Job Simulation on Forage, where I proposed a new feature for The Sims 4, built class diagrams, and optimized the codebase in C++. I gained hands-on experience in game development, feature design, bug fixing, and data structures, and enhanced my communication and technical skills.
