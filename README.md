## Electronic Arts Software Engineering Job Simulation

**ElectronicArts_SoftwareEngineer:** <br>
I completed the Electronic Arts Software Engineering Job Simulation on Forage, where I proposed a new feature for The Sims 4, built class diagrams, and optimized the codebase in C++. I gained hands-on experience in game development, feature design, bug fixing, and data structures, and enhanced my communication and technical skills.

**Repository Overview:**  
This repository showcases my participation in the **Electronic Arts Software Engineering Virtual Experience** on the Forage platform. The simulation provided hands-on experience with key software engineering tasks, focusing on game development for **The Sims 4**. I worked on proposing new features, improving the codebase, and applying object-oriented design principles. This experience helped me refine my skills in **C++**, **class design**, and **game engine technology**.

**Simulation Highlights:**

1. **Feature Proposal**  
   - Proposed a new feature for **The Sims 4** and documented it in a **Feature Proposal**. I learned how to communicate technical ideas effectively to stakeholders, ensuring the proposed feature would align with the game's vision.

2. **Class Diagram & Header File**  
   - Built a **class diagram** to represent the objects in the game and created a **header file** in **C++** to define the class structures. This involved applying **object-oriented design** principles to map out how different elements interact within the game.

3. **Bug Fixing & Code Optimization**  
   - Identified and patched a bug in **The Sims 4** codebase and optimized the existing data structures to improve performance. This task enhanced my understanding of **data structures** and **code optimization** techniques for large, complex codebases.

4. **Object-Oriented Design**  
   - Practiced **object-oriented design** (OOD) by creating and defining class structures that represent the core objects in the game. This experience enhanced my understanding of class design and **code readability**.

**Skills Demonstrated:**
- **Class Design**: Designed and implemented **class diagrams** and header files to represent core game objects using object-oriented principles.
- **Code Readability**: Focused on improving **code readability** by ensuring clear class definitions and maintaining structured code.
- **Communication**: Effectively communicated my feature proposal and technical concepts to stakeholders in a **Feature Proposal** document.
- **Data Structures**: Enhanced my understanding of **data structures** and how they can be optimized for better performance in a game engine.
- **Feature Design**: Gained experience in designing and proposing new features for video games, ensuring they are technically feasible and align with the game’s goals.
- **Game Engine Technology**: Applied fundamental concepts of **game engine technology** to optimize code and contribute to game development.

**Skills Developed:**
- **Code Optimization**: Improved my ability to optimize code and implement more efficient data structures for handling large datasets in game development.
- **Game Development**: Developed a deeper understanding of the complexities involved in building and maintaining video game codebases, especially in the context of **Sims 4**.
- **C++ Programming**: Enhanced my skills in **C++**, particularly in the areas of **class design**, **header file creation**, and **bug fixing**.
- **Object-Oriented Design**: Strengthened my skills in applying **object-oriented design** principles to real-world software development challenges, particularly in game development.

**Objective:**  
This repository documents the key tasks and skills I gained during the **Electronic Arts Software Engineering Job Simulation**. I’m excited to apply what I’ve learned in a **game development team** at **Electronic Arts** or a similar company, where I can contribute to the development of innovative and exciting features for video games.
